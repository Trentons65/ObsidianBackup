### Scenario 1: Network Funtime Company

**Problem**: The lack of standardization, inventory control, and proper system management leads to inefficiencies and security risks. The absence of a streamlined hardware purchasing process and consistent software setup hinders productivity.

**Improvements**:
1. **Standardize Laptop Procurement**: Introduce a standard set of laptop models for different roles (engineering, design, sales). This will reduce setup complexity and improve supportability.
2. **Create an Inventory System**: Implement a basic inventory management system (like Snipe-IT) to track assets, enabling auditing of devices and quick action if a device is lost or stolen.
3. **Pre-configured Laptop Images**: Create and maintain system images for common setups (Linux for engineers, Windows/Mac for others). This will reduce setup time and ensure consistency.
4. **Automate Account and Device Setup**: Use an MDM (Mobile Device Management) tool to automate user account creation, device setup, and software provisioning. This will reduce HR's workload and eliminate manual steps.
5. **Self-service Password Management**: Implement a password management tool that allows employees to reset their machine or cloud service passwords without HR intervention, improving security and reducing HR's burden.

### Scenario 2: W.D. Widgets

**Problem**: Manual machine setup and lack of data backup processes create bottlenecks and high risks to business continuity.

**Improvements**:
1. **Automate Software Provisioning**: Use a deployment tool like Microsoft Endpoint Manager to automate the installation of sales-specific applications, significantly reducing manual work during provisioning.
2. **Cloud-based Email and Messaging**: Migrate email and instant messaging services to cloud providers like Office 365 or Google Workspace. This reduces in-house maintenance and ensures scalability as the company grows.
3. **Automated File Server Backups**: Introduce automated backups of the customer data stored on the file server, and consider storing backups in the cloud for improved redundancy and safety.
4. **Introduce Data Ownership and Permissions**: Implement data ownership policies and access permissions on the file server to ensure proper data governance and prevent accidental data loss.
5. **Scalable IT Infrastructure**: Plan for scalable infrastructure with cloud-based services and automated deployment workflows to accommodate the rapid hiring process without overloading IT resources.

### Scenario 3: Dewgood

**Problem**: The reliance on a single server, inefficient ticketing, and lack of staff knowledge creates a fragile IT environment with potential downtime and frustration for users.

**Improvements**:
1. **Upgrade Ticketing System**: Replace the confusing ticketing system with a more intuitive solution, such as Freshdesk or Zendesk. Provide training to users on how to use it effectively.
2. **Automate User Provisioning and De-provisioning**: Set up automated processes to disable users in Active Directory when they leave, ensuring the integrity and security of the network.
3. **Cloud-hosted Website**: Move the website to a cloud hosting provider (such as AWS or Google Cloud) to improve reliability and reduce dependency on the in-house server.
4. **Cloud Backup of Critical Services**: Use cloud-based backups for important data and services instead of relying on physical disk backups. This improves recovery speed and safety.
5. **Implement a Messaging System**: Introduce an open-source or low-cost messaging system (e.g., Slack) to improve communication between employees and reduce direct reliance on IT for minor issues.
