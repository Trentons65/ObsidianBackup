As an IT Support professional, you may be asked to overclock a CPU. There are steps you should follow to do this as safely as possible. Always make sure that the requestor understands the risks of overclocking before agreeing to perform this procedure. 

    Check if overclocking is supported: First, make sure the CPU is a model that is unlocked for overclocking. Not all CPUs can support overclocking, including most laptop CPUs. Check the CPU manufacturer’s documentation to determine if overclocking is possible for the CPU model. Both Intel and AMD provide overclocking guides and tools for supported CPU models (see below for links to these guides). Additionally, check the documentation for the computer’s motherboard model to ensure that it can support an overclocked CPU.

    Clean the inside of the computer: Turn off and unplug the computer. While wearing an anti-static wristband, open the computer and use compressed air to remove any dust build-up that has accumulated. It is especially important to remove any dust from around the CPU, fans, and intake vents.

    Ensure an appropriate CPU cooler is installed (critical): If the computer has a stock CPU cooler, it is most likely insufficient for cooling an overclocked CPU. Replace the stock CPU cooler with an advanced cooling system, like a liquid cooling system.

    Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for overclocking the CPU: Using the detailed instructions from the manufacturer (see below for links to Intel and AMD’s guides): 

        Use benchmarking software to establish a baseline for the normal performance of the computer.

        Set each CPU core multiplier to the value of the lowest multiplier using either the manufacturer’s overclocking software (recommended) or the BIOS. Then reboot the computer. 

        Increase each CPU core multiplier by 1 to increase the CPU frequency. 

        Test each increase for stability using the testing utility provided by the manufacturer. 

            Fix any problems flagged by the testing tools, especially temperature alerts. If the system becomes too unstable, roll back to the last frequency that produced a stable performance and stop overclocking the CPU.

            If the voltage appears to become insufficient to support the new frequency, increase the voltage by 0.05V. Do not increase the voltage above 1.4V without specialized cooling hardware.

            If the computer freezes or crashes, it has either become completely unstable or the CPU is not getting enough voltage to support the overclocked frequency. Use the BIOS to return to the last stable frequency or increase the voltage in 0.01V increments until stable.

        If stable, reboot the computer before attempting the next increase. 

## Quantities of storage measurements

As data storage grows, the need for new terminology to describe the exponentially larger byte quantities grows too. The current byte nomenclature, mathematical representations, and storage capacities are as follows:

- **One bit:** Also called a binary digit, bits store an electric signal as 1. The absence of an electric signal is stored as 0, which is also the default value of a bit. One bit can store only one value, either 1 or 0. These two possible values are the basis of the binary number system (base-2) that computers use. All numbers in a base-2 system increase exponentially as powers of 2.
    
- **One byte:** One byte stores eight bits of ones and zeros that translate to a symbol or basic computer instruction. Examples: 01101101 is the byte that translates to the letter “m.” The byte 01111111 tells the computer to delete the character to the right of the cursor.
    
- **One kilobyte (1 KB):** 
    
    - **Kilobyte (KB) decimal format:** 103 = 1,000 bytes
        
    - **Kibibyte (KiB) binary format:** 210 = 1,024 bytes
        
    - **Decimal inaccuracy:** Off by -2.4% or -24 bytes

The power supply will have multiple connectors that plug into the motherboard, hard drives, and graphic cards. Each cable has a specific purpose and delivers the appropriate amount of electricity to the following parts:

## Key takeaways

When selecting a power supply for a computer, the following items should be taken into consideration:

1. Wall socket input voltage standard for the country where the computer will be used;
    
2. The number and power consumption needs of the computer’s internal components;
    
3. The motherboard model and form factor engineering specifications and requirements.
