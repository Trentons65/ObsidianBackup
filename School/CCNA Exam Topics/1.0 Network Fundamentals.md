TCP/IP Stack - Physical, Data link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application
## 1.1 Explain the role and function of network components
### 1.1.a Routers
* Routers break up [[Terms/broadcast domain|broadcast]] and [[Terms/collision domain|collision]] domains
Advantages of using routers
1. Don't forward broadcasts by default
2. Filter network based on layer 3 (Internet Layer)
### 1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches
Layer 2 switching (Hardware-based bridging)
* Switches put MAC addresses into filter table w/ receiving port
### 1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS
**NGFW** (Cisco ASA) - L2/3 compatible, packet filtering with IPS & malware inspection, NAT, stateful inspection, VPNs permitted, URL & application filtering, QoS, Third-party integration, & REST API support

### 1.1.d Access points

### 1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)

### 1.1.f Endpoints

### 1.1.g Servers

### 1.1.h PoE
**Power over Ethernet** -
- PoE (802.3af) & PoE+ (802.3at)
- PoE+ is compatible with Gig Ethernet w/ four-wire pairs at 30W
- Power supplied by Ethernet port or a power injector
PoE is implemented at access layer
## 1.2 Describe characteristics of network topology architectures
### 1.2.a Two-tier
Two layer model that combines core and distribution for small companies
### 1.2.b Three-tier
1. Core - Switches network traffic as fast as possible
   * Don't use access lists, route between VLANs, or filter packets
   * Avoid expansion of core (upgrade first)
   * Low convergence protocols should be utilized 
2. Distribution - work-group/ aggregation layer
   * Routing, tools (access lists), and security (NAT+FW)
   * Redistribute between routing protocols
   * Route between VLANs
   * Defines broadcast and multicast domains
3. Access - controls use and work-group access to network
   * Continued use of access control and policies
   * Creation of collision domains
   * Device connectivity
   * QoS marking
### 1.2.c Spine-leaf
Top of rack switches act as leaf switches that interconnect servers, firewalls, load-balancing, and switches.
### 1.2.d WAN

**Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)** - Equipment owned by subscriber
   
**Channel/ Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU)** -
   * Source/ Destination for digital data to be considered DTE
   * Used to connect DTE to T1/T3 line 
   * Provides clocking of line to router

**Demarc point** - Where service provider's responsibility ends and CPE begins
   
**Local loop** - Connects demarc point to closest switching office
   
**Central office (Point of Presence (PoP))** - Connects customers network to providers switching network
   
**Toll network** -
- Trunk line inside WAN
- Collection of switches and facilities owned by ISP

**Optical Fiber Converter** - Converts between Fiber and Electrical 

| Level | Speed |
| ---- | ---- |
| Digital Signal 0 | 64 Kbps |
| T1 (24 DS0) | 1.54 Mbps |
| E1 (30 DS0) | 2.048 Mbps |
| T3 (28 DS1) | 44.736 Mbps |
| OC3 (3 DS3) | 155.52 Mbps |
| OC12 | 622.08 Mbps |
| OC48 | 2488.32 Mbps |
### 1.2.e Small office/home office (SOHO)
**Small Office Home Office (SOHO)** - Small network w/ one router & 1/2 switches 
### 1.2.f On-premise and cloud

## 1.3 Compare physical interface and cabling types
### 1.3.a Single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, copper
IEEE Standards

| Standard | Cable Type |
| ---- | ---- |
| 802.3 | 10Base-T |
| 802.3u | 100Base-TX,FX |
| 802.3z | 1000Base-CX,SX,LX |
| 802.3ab | 1000Base-T |
| 802.3an | 10GBase-T |
**Straight-Through Cable (10Base-T & 100Base-T)** -
- Connects host to switch/router to switch
- Transmits/Receives on pins (1 & 2)/(3 & 6)
**Crossover Cable (10Base-T & 100Base-T)** -
- Auto-mdix makes these obsolete
- Connects switch to switch/router to host
- Transmits/Receives on pins (3 & 6)/(1 &2)
- 1000Base-T UTP uses pins(1 & 3), (2 & 6), (4/5 & 7/8)
**Fiber-optic Cable** -
1. Single-mode - More expensive, tight cladding, far distances 
2. Multi-mode - Less expensive and shorter distance than single-mode
### 1.3.b Connections (Ethernet shared media and point-to-point)
  
## 1.4 Identify interface and cable issues (collisions, errors, mismatch duplex, and/or speed)
  
## 1.5 Compare TCP to UDP
**Telnet** - Insecure remote connection

**SSH** - Secure remote connection w/ encryption

**FTP** - Protocol/ Program used to transfer files (Can't execute remote files as programs)

**TFTP** - Insecure version of FTP w/o extra functions (Only send & receive)

**SNMP** - Collects and manipulates network info by using a Network Management Station (NMS)

**HTTP/HTTPS** - Secure version uses SSL to receive web pages from servers

**NTP** - Synchronizes devices to ensure devices agree on time (Atomic clock used)

**DNS** - Resolves hosts from IP
1.  Host name entered in URL
2. Application layer
3. UDP request to DNS server
4. Root DNS server 
5. Server returns IP
- **Fully Quantified Domain Name (FQDN)** - Hierarchy that can logically locate system based on domain identifier 
  
**DHCP** - Provides clients with IP addressing
1. Client broadcasts ***DISCOVER*** message looking for server (port 67)
2. Server sends layer 2 unicast ***OFFER*** message back to host
3. Client broadcasts ***REQUEST*** message to server
4. Server finishes exchange w/ unicast ***ACK***
